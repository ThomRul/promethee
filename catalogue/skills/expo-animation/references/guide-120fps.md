## 120fps

On ProMotion iPhones, third-party animations are capped at 60fps unless `CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone` is set. Recent Expo SDKs set it by default — confirm it's there, and add it if not:

```json
{ "expo": { "ios": { "infoPlist": { "CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone": true } } } }
```

Then the frame budget is 8ms, not 16. This is also why a UI-thread animation matters more on mobile than it does on web.
