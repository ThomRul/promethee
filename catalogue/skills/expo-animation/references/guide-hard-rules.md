## Hard Rules

1. **Run the sequence in order.** Steps 1 and 2 gate everything.
2. **Reanimated, not core `Animated`.** Core `Animated` can't be driven by a gesture without crossing the bridge, and `useNativeDriver` refuses anything but transform and opacity anyway. Reanimated worklets run on the UI thread and keep running while JS is busy.
3. **No approximated values.** Curves and spring configs come from the tables below.
4. **Reduced motion ships with the animation**, not as a follow-up.
5. **Feel is judged on a release build on the slowest device you support.** Nothing else counts as verified.
